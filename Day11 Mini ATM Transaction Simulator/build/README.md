The program begins by including the standard input/output library, <stdio.h>, and the standard library, <stdlib.h>, for functions like exit(). It then initializes the account balance and transaction counter.
A do-while loop is used to continuously display the menu and process user choices until the user selects the "Exit" option or reaches the maximum number of transactions. The menu options are presented to the user
A switch statement is used to execute different code blocks based on the user's input. Each case corresponds to a menu option.
The loop condition checks if the user's choice is not '4' (Exit) and if the transaction count is less than 5. If the user exits or the transaction limit is reached, the loop terminates.
display a transaction summary before exiting after the loop , the program prints a summary of the session ,including the total number of transactions and final balance.
